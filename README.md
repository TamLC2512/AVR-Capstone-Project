This is my capstone project at university. My team included two members and we completed it in December 2024.
We designed a KIT for testing and practicing, along with a document for teaching the Application Microcontroller subject.
In this project, my duty was to design tutorials on topics such as GPIO, reading sensors (ADC values), external interrupts, timers, etc., using the ATMEGA328P on CodeVision.
My partner was responsible for the hardware.
I uploaded all the source codes for the ATMEGA328P tutorials and this is a video about my KIT. Please click the link.
