This is my capstone project at the University. My team included 2 members and we competed it on December 2024.
We designed the KIT for testing and practicing and a document for teaching the Application Microcontroller Subject.
In this project, my duty is design the tutorials like: GPIO, reading sensor (ADC value), External Interrupt, Timer,... with ATMEGA328P on CodeVision App.
And my partner is responsible for hardware.
I uploaded all source codes for the ATMEGA328P toturial and this is a video about my KIT. Please click to the link. https://youtu.be/cE8vUNefbk8
